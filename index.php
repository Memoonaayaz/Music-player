                    February, and the flowers haven't even wilted <br>
                    It's crazy how fast you tilted <br>
                    The world that we were busy buildin' <br>
                    Mid-November, and I'm sippin' on a half-cold coffee <br>
                    Starin' at a girl who's not me <br>
                    On your arm, a carbon copy <br>
                    Feels like we had matching wounds <br>
                    But mine's still black and bruised <br>
                    And yours is perfectly fine now <br>
                    Feels like we buried alive <br>
                    Something that never died <br>
                    So, God, it hurt when I found out <br>
                    You love her, it's over <br>
                    Do you even doubt it on your lips? <br>
                    When you say it, say it? <br>
                    You love her, it's over <br>
                    You already found someone to miss <br>
                    While I'm still standin' at the exit <br>
                    I'm still standin' at the exit <br>
                    I can't hate you for gettin' everything we wanted <br>
                    I just thought that I would be part of it <br>
                    I was movin' into your apartment <br>
                    When you met someone, she's from your hometown <br>
                    You hate the East Coast, it's where you live now <br>
                    Impossible to understand how you're not comin' back <br>
                    But I can't say it out loud <br>
                    You love her, it's over <br>
                    Do you even doubt it on your lips? <br>
                    When you say it, say it? <br>
                    You love her, it's over <br>
                    You already found someone to miss <br>
                    While I'm still standin' at the exit <br>
                    I'm still standin' at the exit <br>
                    Feels like we had matching wounds <br>
                    But mine's still black and bruised <br>
                    And yours is perfectly fine <br>
                    Feels like we buried alive <br>
                    Something that never died <br>
                    So, God, it hurt when I found out <br>
                    You love her <br>
                    It's over <br>
                    Do you even doubt it on your lips? <br>
                    When you say it, say it? <br>
                    You love her <br>
                    It's over <br>
                    You already found someone to miss <br>
                    So, God, it hurt when I found out <br>
